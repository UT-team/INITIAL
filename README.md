INitial InTegral ALgorithm: A package for obtaining the transformation matrix to a canonical basis from one Feynman integral of uniform transcendental weight.

This Mathematica package is based on the following publication:

* Christoph Dlapa, Johannes Henn and Kai Yan, _Deriving canonical differential equations for Feynman integrals from a single uniform weight integral_, [arxiv:2002.02340](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02340)


## Installation

Written completely in Mathematica, this package requires no installation other than its dependencies:

This package relies on the [FiniteFlow](https://github.com/peraro/finiteflow) framework (see [arXiv:1905.08019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08019) for more information).
